Had a little fun making this simple yet groovy app! It was nice to refresh myself on a few things and also to learn a thing or two such as;

* HTML `data-` attribute - In HTML, the data-* attributes are used to store custom data private to the page or application. These attributes allow you to attach additional 
  information to HTML elements without affecting their rendering or behavior. The data-key attribute, for example, is not a built-in attribute like class or id; it's a custom 
  attribute that you can define to store specific data associated with an element.
  
* Refreshed myself on the use of event listeners.


I did run into a couple of small but annoying problems whilst making the app but managed to figure them out eventually. The two problems I had were;

* A misplaced quotation mark stopped the sound from playing (pictured below)

* I couldn't get the transition to end correctly because I forgot to use `document.querySelectorAll` instead of `document.querySelector`
